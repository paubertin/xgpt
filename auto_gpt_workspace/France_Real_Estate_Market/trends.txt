The current trends in the French real estate market are a rebalancing or structural decline, with a slowdown in the rise of volumes and a deceleration in prices. While the cumulative volume of transactions in old properties over the last twelve months in France is still higher than the record set at the end of 2019 before the health crisis, the slowdown observed since the 4th quarter of 2021 has accelerated in recent months, reaching -6% year-on-year since August 2022. Prices of old apartments and old houses continue to rise, but the magnitude of price changes is more contained in the 3rd quarter of 2022, with the return of price negotiations and energy performance becoming a factor in price negotiations. The real estate market is rebalancing due to the end of the momentum following the health crisis and the continued rise in real estate rates. The continuing rise in interest rates is excluding more and more people from the property market, in the face of a greater demand for down payments. The property market could continue to decline, given the great number of clouds gathering over it, even though the appetite of the French for the safe haven of real estate is undiminished.
